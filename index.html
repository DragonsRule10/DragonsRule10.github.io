 <h1> Want a plugin for your Forge Server, or a custom mod for your survival world? </h1>
  <div></div><p1> Right now the only version we make plugins/mods for is 1.19.4 and Forge.</p1></div>

<p1> As my software updates and forge adds support for 1.20, I will start making plugins/mods for those versions.</p1>

  <h1> Step-by-step on how to request a plugin! </h1>
<div></div><p1> Made a request in the <a href="https://discord.gg/55kXaX8zx4">Discord Server</a></p1></div>
<p1> Have a staff member look at your request and deem if it is possibile to be created.</p1>
<div><p1> Once that is complete I will be tagged and we can discuss your request!</p1></div>

  <p1> All plugin data is sent over Discord, and Discord ONLY.</p1>

  <div><p1> If you ever have a problem with your plugin feel free to make another ticket.</p1></div>

  <h2> Payment </h2>
<p1> Payment is done by the KB/2.</p1>

  <div><p1> For instance, if a file you are sent is 12.44 KB, your charge is $6.22.</p1></div>

  <p1>For now, all plugins/mods we make are free of charge.</p1>
