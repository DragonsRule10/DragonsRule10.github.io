  <h1>Welcome.</h1>
  <h2> I'm Tristin, aka DragonsRule10. </h2>

<h3> I know how to make some website html, also some java/js. </h3>
  <p1> If you ever have questions about me, feel free to ask! </p1>

 <h1> Want a plugin for your Forge Server, or a custom mod for your survival world? </h1>
  <p1> Right now the only version we make plugins/mods for is 1.19.4 and Forge.</p1>

<p1> As my software updates and forge adds support for 1.20, I will start making plugins/mods for those versions.</p1>

  <h1> Step-by-step on how to request a plugin! </h1>
[x] Made a request in the <a href="https://discord.gg/55kXaX8zx4">Discord Server</a>
[x] Have a staff member look at your request and deem if it is possibile to be created.
[x] Once that is complete I will be tagged and we can discuss your request! ðŸŽ‰

  <p1> All plugin data is sent over Discord, and Discord ONLY.</p1>

  <p1> If you ever have a problem with your plugin feel free to make another ticket.</p1>

  <h2> Payment </h2>
<p1> Payment is done by the KB/2.</p1>

  <p1> For instance, if a file you are sent is 12.44 KB, your charge is $6.22.</p1>

  <p1>For now, all plugins/mods we make are free of charge.</p1>

  <p1>Get this amazing deal while it last!</p1>
