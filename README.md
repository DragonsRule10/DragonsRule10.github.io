# Welcome.
## I'm Tristin, aka DragonsRule10.

> If you ever have questions about me, feel free to ask!

# Want a plugin for your Forge Server?
> Right now the only version I make plugins for is 1.19.4 and Forge.

> As my software updates and forge adds support for 1.20, I will start making plugins for those versions.

# Step-by-step on how to request a plugin!
- [x] Made a request in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/55kXaX8zx4).
- [x] Have a staff member look at your request and deem if it is possibile to be created.
- [x] Once that is complete I will be tagged and we can discus your request! ðŸŽ‰

> All plugin data is sent over Discord, and Discord ONLY.

> If you ever have a problem with your plugin feel free to make another ticket.

## Payment
>As Dragon Studio is a starting busness, I need time to think about how payment will workout along with the pricing.

>For now, all plugins/mods i make are free of charge.

>(Check back later as this may change!)
